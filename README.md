### Brief project description

This project is designed to develop sophisticated analytical models and methods for forecasting electricity demand, supporting decision-making and strategic planning for entities within the energy sector. The analysis will employ historical electricity demand data, temperature records, and previous forecasts from various regions, aiming to produce not only precise demand predictions but also probabilistic outcomes to enhance understanding. Additionally, it will create synthetic data to depict potential future scenarios, aiding in the robust testing of these models and offering insights into the historical demand trends. The successful implementation of this project is expected to lead to enhanced forecasting accuracy, improved scenario-based planning with synthetic data, more effective operational decision-making, and superior risk management. The overarching aim is to establish an advanced analytical framework that elucidates the intricate interplay among demand, climatic conditions, economic indicators, and other significant factors, thereby offering substantial support to the broader energy sector.
