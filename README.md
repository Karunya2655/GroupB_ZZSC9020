# Welcome to ZZSC9020 GitHub repository for group [GROUP-B]

This GitHub repository is the main point of access for students and lecturers of the ZZSC9020 capstone course. 

In this repository, you will find the data to start developing your project. Also, we will use the repository to share code, documentation, data, models and other resources between the group members and course lecturers.

### Brief project description

This project aims to develop advanced analytical models and techniques for forecasting electricity demand in order to support decision-making and planning for businesses and regulatory bodies in the energy sector. The analysis will leverage historical data on electricity demand, temperature records, and past demand forecasts across different regions. Key objectives include generating accurate forecasts of future demand along with probabilistic distributions rather than just point estimates, creating synthetic data to represent a range of plausible future scenarios for stress-testing models, and providing insights into the drivers behind past demand outcomes. Successful execution of this project would enable improved demand forecasting capabilities, better long-term planning through scenario analysis using synthetic data, optimized operational decisions, and enhanced risk management strategies. The ultimate goal is to develop a powerful analytical framework that captures the complex relationships between demand, weather patterns, economic factors, and other relevant variables to support the broader energy industry. The research will make use of temperature records, historical data on electricity demand, and demand estimates from previous years for various regions in New South Wales. The creation of synthetic data to represent a variety of conceivable future scenarios for stress-testing models, accurate forecasting of future demand along with probabilistic distributions rather than just point estimates, and insights into the factors influencing previous demand outcomes are among the main goals. Successful execution of this project will lead to better demand forecasting abilities, better long-term planning through scenario analysis with synthetic data, better operational decision-making, and improved risk management techniques. The end objective is to create a strong analytical framework to support the energy sector as a whole by capturing the intricate relationships between demand, weather patterns, economic factors, and other pertinent variables.
